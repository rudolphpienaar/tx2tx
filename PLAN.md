# Resumption State & Next Steps (as of 2026-01-15)

This document tracks the development plan. The section below outlines the current status to allow for asynchronous work.

## 1. Current Goal
The primary objective is to perform the first real-world, two-device test of the `tx2tx` application to validate its core functionality.

## 2. Summary of Recent Progress
- A detailed code and design gap analysis was completed. Key findings include potential mouse movement distortion between screens with different aspect ratios, incorrect key mappings if keyboard layouts differ, and a lack of encryption.
- A critical `IndentationError` was found in `tx2tx/server/main.py` which prevented the server from starting.
- This indentation bug has been **fixed, committed, and pushed** to the `main` branch.

## 3. Current Blocker: Environment Incompatibility
- The initial test attempt on a Chromebook (Crostini) using `cosmic-session` failed. The server's cursor would not trigger the screen-edge transition.
- **Diagnosis:** This is because `tx2tx` is a native X11 application, but `cosmic-session` is a Wayland environment. The XWayland compatibility layer prevents `tx2tx` from correctly reading the global cursor position, which is fundamental to its design.

## 4. Next Action Plan
1.  **Switch Environment:** The user will stop the current session and switch from the Wayland-based environment to a native X11 session for testing.
2.  **Proposed Environment:** Use **Xephyr** to create a nested X-server window and run the **Enlightenment** window manager within it. This provides a pure X11 desktop, which is the correct environment for `tx2tx`.
3.  **Resume Testing:** Once the new environment is active, the two-device test should be re-attempted.

## 5. Test Procedure Reference
- **Find Server IP:** On the server device, run `ip addr show wlan0 | grep "inet "`
- **Server Command:** `tx2tx`
- **Client Command:** `tx2tx --server <SERVER_IP>:24800`

# tx2tx Implementation Plan

## INVARIANT: Architectural Overview

### Core Principle: Server-Authoritative Dumb Terminal Model

**Server is ground truth:**
- Server maintains all state (ScreenContext, cursor visibility, transitions)
- Server detects ALL transitions (both directions) using its own screen edges
- Server sends normalized coordinates (0.0-1.0) to clients
- Clients are dumb terminals that only react when server sends data

**Why this works:**
- Hidden server cursor moves across the server screen while controlling remote client.
- **Center -> Remote:** Server detects cursor crossing outer edge (e.g., Left edge -> West Client).
- **Remote -> Center:** Server detects hidden cursor crossing inner edge (e.g., Right edge while in West Context -> Back to Center).
- No client-side state tracking, boundary detection, or decision making.
- No client geometry needed on server (normalized coordinates handle arbitrary resolutions).

**CRITICAL: Input Isolation During REMOTE Mode**

When context != CENTER, server must prevent desktop environment from seeing input events:
- **Pointer grab:** Capture mouse button clicks (prevent server desktop from reacting to clicks)
- **Keyboard grab:** Capture keyboard events (prevent typing/commands on server desktop)
- Server reads events from X11 event queue and forwards to client
- Server desktop environment sees NO events during REMOTE mode
- On return to CENTER: ungrab both, restore normal desktop interaction

### State Machine

#### Enums

```python
class ScreenContext(Enum):
    """Global context - which screen has active control"""
    CENTER = "center"  # Server (TX2TX) has control, cursor SHOWN
    WEST = "west"      # Client at west position has control, cursor HIDDEN
    EAST = "east"      # Client at east position has control, cursor HIDDEN
    NORTH = "north"    # Client at north position has control, cursor HIDDEN
    SOUTH = "south"    # Client at south position has control, cursor HIDDEN
```

#### State Transitions

```
STATE: context=CENTER
  - Server cursor visible on physical display
  - Server polls cursor position
  - Server monitors for boundary crossings at edges

  TRANSITION: CENTER → WEST (example)
    Server detects: cursor_x <= 0 with velocity >= threshold
    1. context = WEST
    2. Grab pointer (capture mouse button events)
    3. Grab keyboard (capture keyboard events)
    4. Hide server cursor
    5. Position server cursor at x = (server_width - 1), y = current_y (Right Edge)
    6. Start sending normalized positions to WEST client

STATE: context=WEST (or EAST/NORTH/SOUTH)
  - Server cursor hidden
  - Pointer and keyboard grabbed (server desktop sees NO input)
  - User moves mouse on server surface
  - Server continuously:
    - Polls hidden cursor position
    - Normalizes: norm_x = cursor_x / server_width
    - Sends normalized events to client
    - Checks for RETURN condition (e.g., hitting Right Edge while in WEST context)
  
  TRANSITION: WEST → CENTER (example)
    Server detects: cursor_x >= (server_width - 1) (Right Edge of Server)
    1. context = CENTER
    2. Send (-1, -1) to client (hide cursor signal)
    3. Position server cursor at x = 1, y = current_y (Left Edge)
    4. Show server cursor
    5. Ungrab keyboard/pointer
```

### Configuration

```yaml
server:
  name: "TX2TX"
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 24800
  edge_threshold: 0
  velocity_threshold: 100
  poll_interval_ms: 20

clients:
  - name: "phomux"
    position: west
  - name: "tablet"
    position: east

logging:
  level: "INFO"
```

### Protocol

**Server → Client messages:**
```python
# Normal mouse movement (during context != CENTER)
MOUSE_MOVE(norm_x: float, norm_y: float)

# Hide cursor signal (transitioning back to CENTER)
MOUSE_MOVE(norm_x: -1.0, norm_y: -1.0)  # Special code

# Keyboard events
KEY_EVENT(...)
```

**Client → Server messages:**
- Handshake only (capabilities/screen info).
- NO control logic messages (e.g., SCREEN_ENTER is deprecated).
