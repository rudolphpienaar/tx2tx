= tx2tx Client Architecture

== 1. Problem Scope

The client is the event application endpoint. It does not decide global context; it receives server messages and applies them deterministically through the selected backend. Its main correctness requirement is faithful replay of remote intent without local state drift.

== 2. Module Structure

The client path is intentionally narrower than the server path.

[source,text]
----
client/main.py
  -> client.runtime (loop + handlers)
  -> client.network (transport)
  -> backend adapter (x11 or wayland)

shared dependencies:
  - protocol/message.py
  - common/types.py
  - input/backend interfaces
----

== 3. Runtime Flow

[source,text]
----
connect -> handshake
while connected:
  receive message
  decode by message type
  dispatch to injector/display handling
----

Representative message classes:

- pointer motion / button events
- key events
- control-plane messages (enter/leave, keepalive, etc.)

== 4. Injection Responsibilities

Client injection logic is backend-specific but architecturally consistent:

1. decode protocol payload into typed event model
2. translate to backend-native operation
3. apply operation with minimal side effects

The client should not reinterpret server context; it applies received intent.

== 5. Software Cursor Behavior

When software cursor mode is active, cursor rendering is local to the client and must respond to server position events and hide commands. Cursor lifecycle belongs to client runtime/UI handling, not server transition policy.

== 6. Failure Semantics

Client failures are handled as endpoint failures: connection loss, injection exceptions, or backend unavailability should close/tear down cleanly and report state to logs. Recovery authority remains server-side.

== 7. Testing Focus

Client-side tests should prioritize:

- message decode correctness
- injection mapping correctness
- connection lifecycle robustness
- software cursor behavior consistency

These concerns are intentionally orthogonal to server transition-state tests.
